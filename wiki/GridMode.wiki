The fundamental concept behind Grid Mode is the unit block. By default the size of a unit block is 100 by 100 pixels. With this unit block, you could capture predefined sizes such as 

|| 100x100 || 200x100 || 300x100 ||
|| 100x200 || 200x200 || 300x200 ||
|| 100x300 || 200x300 || 300x300 ||

In order to successfully generate a predefine portion, 
 
 # Press the Crop Shot hotkey 
 # Press the PMB once, drag to create the desired area
 # Keep holding the PMB and use the Up|Down|Left|Right keys to position the rectangle to satisfaction
 # Release the PMB
