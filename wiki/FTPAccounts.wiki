= FTP Account Syntax =

The usual URL creation procedure is as follows:
{{{
URL = HttpHomePath + SubFolderPath + FileName
}}}

This default behavior can be customized. 

If HttpHomePath starts with the @ char then, 
{{{
URL = HttpHomePath + FileName
}}}
If HttpHomePath is empty then,
{{{
URL = Host + SubFolderPath + FileName
}}}

Notes:

If URL not starts with http:// then will be added automatically.
Also / chars will be handled automatically you don't need to add / char to beginning or end of paths.
If Host starts with ftp. then will be automatically removed while making URL. (For empty HttpHomePath or using % in HttpHomePath)

Examples:
== Standard usage ==
=== Using IP address ===
{{{
Host: 80.123.456.78
SubFolderPath: ZScreen
HttpHomePath: zscreen.net/jaex
URL: http://zscreen.net/jaex/ZScreen/screenshot.jpg
}}}
=== Using domain ==
{{{
Host: ftp.zscreen.net
SubFolderPath:
HttpHomePath:
URL: http://zscreen.net/screenshot.jpg
}}}
=== Using subdomain ===
{{{
Host: jaex.zscreen.net
SubFolderPath: ZScreen/Screenshots
HttpHomePath: www.zscreen.net/jaex
URL: http://www.zscreen.net/jaex/ZScreen/Screenshots/screenshot.jpg
}}}
== Empty HttpHomePath ==
=== Using domain ==
{{{

SubFolderPath: ZScreen
HttpHomePath:
