= Automatic folder creation = 

ZScreen can automatically create sub-folders in your FTP Server based on the SubFolderPath settings. FTP Path of a file is shown below:
{{{
URL = ftp:// + Host + : + Port + SubFolderPath + FileName
}}}

= URL creation based on FTP Account settings =

The usual URL creation procedure is as follows:
{{{
URL = HttpHomePath + SubFolderPath + FileName
}}}

This default behavior of URL creation can be customized. 

If HttpHomePath starts with the @ char then, 
{{{
URL = HttpHomePath + FileName
}}}
If HttpHomePath is empty then,
{{{
URL = Host + SubFolderPath + FileName
}}}

== Notes ==

If URL does not start with * http:// * then it will be added automatically. The */* char will be handled automatically; you don't need to add */* char to the beginning or end of paths.

If Host starts with *ftp.* then it will be automatically removed while making URL (when using empty HttpHomePath or when using % in HttpHomePath).
