ZScreen is a power and flexible Screen capture-cum-upload software.
It has various capture modes: 
  * Crop shot (any random region of the screen)
  * Selected window part
  * Active window (when multiple windows are open on the screen)
  * Freehand crop shot (draw any freehand shape to capture specific parts of screen)
  * Webpage (scroll down the page and capture the entire page)

After capturing, you can optionally edit the image.
  * Built-in editor
  * Select any external editor (GIMP, InkScape, etc.)

Upload the raw or edited image to any host service of your choice.
