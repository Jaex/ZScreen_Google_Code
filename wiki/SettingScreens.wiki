#summary Overview of setting screens in ZScreen.

ZScreen is very flexible. Practically all operations can be configured.

The ZScreen settings are divided in tabs. <br/>
These tabs are arranged logically, in the order of operations. <br/>
Some of the tabs have sub-tabs.

The tabs are:
  * Main: Quick general-purpose settings
  * Hotkeys: Change the keyboard shortcuts to your liking
  * Capture: Settings related to all different screen-capture modes
  * Actions: Actions that can be taken on the captured image (e.g. edit)
  * Destinations: Set the destinations for uploading.
  * History: If there is an error in an upload, trace it and correct the mistake.
  * Translator: User Google Translator to translate the contents of your clipboard.
  * Options: General program options (unrelated with screen-capture or uploading)
  * Advanced options: Detailed options
